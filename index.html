                <p class="carddd">Vaccine hesitancy – the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the
                    availability of vaccines – threatens to reverse progress made in tackling 
                    vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective
                    ways of avoiding disease – it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, 
                    and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved. 
                    Measles, for example, has seen a 30% increase in cases globally. 
                    The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to
                    vaccine hesitancy. However, some countries that were close to eliminating the
                   disease have seen a resurgence.

                <p class="carddd">Primary health care is usually the first point of contact people have
                    with their health care system, and ideally should provide comprehensive,
                    affordable, community-based care throughout life. 
                    Primary health care can meet the majority of a person’s health needs of
                    the course of their life. Health systems with strong primary health care are needed to achieve universal health coverage. 
                    Yet many countries do not have adequate primary health care facilities. 
                    This neglect may be a lack of resources in low- or middle-income countries,
                     but possibly also a focus in the past few decades on single disease programmes.

                <img src="img/climatesnow.png" alt="Climate change">
                <p class="carddd">Noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease, are collectively responsible for over 70% of all deaths worldwide, or 41 million people. This includes 15 million people dying prematurely, aged between 30 and 69.     
                    Over 85% of these premature deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. 
                    The rise of these diseases has been driven by five major risk factors: 
                    tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets
                    and air pollution. These risk factors also exacerbate mental health issues,
                    that may originate from an early age: half of all mental illness begins by 
                    he age of 14, but most cases go undetected and untreated – suicide is 
                    the second leading cause of death among 15-19 year-olds.
                    Among many things, this year WHO will work with governments to help 
                    them meet the global target of reducing physical inactivity by 15% by 
                    2030 – through such actions as implementing the ACTIVE policy toolkit 
                    to help get more people being active every day.</p>

              weak health services leave them without access to basic care. 
              Fragile settings exist in almost all regions of the world, and these
